# UAH_APP

The UAH Navigation Application will give users the luxury of having a refinement of the Google Maps API that will lead them to their
desired location within the UAH Campus. The Application will allow users to search for their destination by selecting the Class ID, Room
Number, or Building ID, and will lead the user to the room. When the user enters a building, the app will open up a floor plan with a
traced path to lead the users to their destination. This Application will focus on development for Android-compatible devices.

## The Need for this Project

Imagine that you are in Scenario 1 or 2. You have a general idea of where the building is from the online campus map, and your favorite
navigation app. But you have no idea what the interior layout of the rooms are once you get inside. So, you decide to wing it and assume
that there will be some map inside of the building that will guide you to your destination

### Some examples of current problems in the campus buildings that this Android application would address:

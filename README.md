# UAH_APP

The UAH Navigation Application will give users the luxury of having a refinement of the Google Maps API that will lead them to their desired location within the UAH Campus. The Application will allow users to search for their destination by selecting the Class ID, Room Number, or Building ID, and will lead the user to the room. When the user enters a building, the app will open up a floor plan with a traced path to lead the users to their destination. This Application will focus on development for Android-compatible devices.
